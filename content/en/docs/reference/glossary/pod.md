  The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A Pod represents a set of running {{< glossary_tooltip text="containers" term_id="container" >}} on your cluster.

A Pod is typically set up to run a single primary container. It can also run optional sidecar containers that add supplementary features like logging. Pods are commonly managed by a {% glossary_tooltip term_id="deployment" %}.
